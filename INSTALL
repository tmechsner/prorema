Installing PROREMA
-------------------

The application works with apache maven build system and Spring Boot as basic framework.
Spring Boot already includes a Tomcat servlet container / web server.

Thus it does not require any further setup except for the database.

We provide two modes for running the application:
1. Standalone with an external database (MySql preconfigured)
2. Standalone with an embedded in-memory H2 database (non persistent, demo data attached)


Configuration
--------------

Database connection and server port can be configured in application-default.properties.
A example configuration is provided.
Configurations for databases other than MySql can be found on the internet.

After starting MySql configuration, please comment out the line
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create
in application-default.properties to keep your database when the application needs to be restarted.
Reenable this line to reset the database to initial state and throw away all manually added data on startup.


Execution
----------

Finally to run the application with an external database just call
mvn clean spring-boot:run

For running the application with the in-memory H2 database preloaded with dummy-data please call
mvn clean spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=inmemory


First Login
------------

In the demo dataset each user's username is the first letter of his/her first name and the full last name.
For David Rema it is "drema".
All users have the password "password".

In the MySql dataset the following entities are provided:
 - Two admin users with usernames "admin1" / "admin2" and password "password",
 - An organisation unit for the admins,
 - A dummy project for absence (holidays, illness, ...).
